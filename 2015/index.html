            The goal of this weight loss competition is NOT to lose a lot of weight quickly. Instead, the focus of this competition is to promote healthy weight loss, and for competitors to maintain a healthy weight. Competitors will NOT be penalized for meeting their goals. Every person has a chance to win.

          <p><h2>Rules/Guidelines:</h2></p>
          <p>
            <ol>
              <li>The competition lasts 4 months. (January 20th - May 18th)</li>
              <li>To enter the competition, there is an entry fee of $50.</li>
              <li>You set your own weight loss goal.</li>
              <li>Every Monday, competitors are weighed. Points are awarded as follows:
                <ul>
                  <li>Competitors who lose weight during the week receive 1 point.</li>
                  <li>Competitors who DO NOT lose weight receive 0 points.</li>
                  <li>Competitors who do not lose weight, but meet and/or are maintaining their set goal receive 1 point.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>As a week by week incentive, each competitor who wins a point can inflict the week’s punishment on the competitors who did not win a point.
                <ul>
                  <li>Each week’s punishment will be push-ups equal to the current week of the competition multiplied by 2. (Week one is 2 push-ups, week two is 4 push-ups, etc.)</li>
                  <li>Each winning competitor can demand punishment from each losing competitor, but only once during the week. The timing of the punishment is up to the winning competitor.</li>
                  <li>Losing competitors must perform the punishment IMMEDIATELY.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>If you meet and maintain your set goal at the end of the competition, your $50 entry fee is returned to you.</li>
              <li>If you fail to meet your set goal, your $50 is awarded to the winner(s).</li>
              <li>The winner is the person(s) with the most points.</li>
              <li>A special award is also awarded to the person who goes above and beyond their goal. This award is determined by a vote at the end of the competition from all competitors.</li>
            </ol>
